## Course Description

Angular was designed by Google to address challenges programmers face building single-page applications.
In this course Luke Angel steps through the framework one step at a time, focusing on the new component-based architecture of Angular 2. After completing this training, you'll be able to tackle the other project-based courses in our library and create your own Angular app.
JavaScript frameworks help you code more quickly, by providing special functionality for developing specific types of web projects.  This course introduces you to the essentials of this "superheroic" framework, including declarative templates, two-way data binding, and dependency injection. 

Topics include:
- What is Angular?
- Setting up an Angular templates
- Working with components
